This was the first project I did on my own, and without solid knowledge in machine learning algorithms. The same database of 144 countries has been used. Creating 6 models with small modifications to visualize the differences. 

Summary:
The Covid-19 had negative effects that affect the whole society because of the interconnection between countries, and the influence of States on the population they support. As it is a current issue, and one that is underway, it is interesting to know what serious consequences it is bringing about.
This project aims to carry out a statistical analysis to find out which factors are affected by the virus, as well as to analyse the impact it causes at a macroeconomic and social level. The aim is to give clear and reliable conclusions on the evolution of the virus and its influence.
Various statistical techniques will be applied to carry out the study. Databases and reference information will be sought in order to contextualize and understand these data. The analysis of the data will be carried out from different databases and selected sources.

Keywords: Covid-19; database; statistical techniques; statistical analysis; CART Decision Trees; statistical programme R.

Tools: R, RCommander, CART (classifier and Regression Trees).
