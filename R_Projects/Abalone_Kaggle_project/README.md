## Abalone
You are working as an intern for an abalone farming operation in Japan. For operational and environmental reasons, it is an important consideration to estimate the age of the abalones when they go to market.

Determining an abalone's age involves counting the number of rings in a cross-section of the shell through a microscope. Since this method is somewhat cumbersome and complex, you are interested in helping the farmers estimate the age of the abalone using its physical characteristics.


You have access to the following historical data (source):

Abalone characteristics:
"sex" - M, F, and I (infant).
"length" - longest shell measurement.
"diameter" - perpendicular to the length.
"height" - measured with meat in the shell.
"whole_wt" - whole abalone weight.
"shucked_wt" - the weight of abalone meat.
"viscera_wt" - gut-weight.
"shell_wt" - the weight of the dried shell.
"rings" - number of rings in a shell cross-section.
"age" - the age of the abalone: the number of rings + 1.5.

Create a report that covers the following:

- How does weight change with age for each of the three sex categories?
- Can you estimate an abalone's age using its physical characteristics?
- Investigate which variables are better predictors of age for abalones.
