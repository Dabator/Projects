## Videogames analysis

This project has been elaborated thanks to the knowledge acquired during the master's degree. 
The topic of the research deals with the video game trade, which is a booming market with increasing profits every year. 

Summary:
Every investment seems to pay off, and this study has proven this.
In this study, a statistical analysis was carried out on 40 of the most popular games with economic and valuation variables, as well as descriptive variables. The database was obtained from a single source due to the difficulty of finding reference information. 
With this database, a principal component analysis and a hierarchical grouping of these principal components was carried out, in order to find out which group has obtained the highest revenue and why. We found 3 groups in the analysis, and the group with the highest revenue coincides with the majority of AAA games, which are the ones with the highest investment. 

Keywords: R, RSTUDIO, Video games; database; statistical techniques; principal component analysis (PCA); hierarchical clustering of principal components (HCPC).
